# Kainos Brand Rules — Operational Cheat Sheet

> All `references/...` paths below are relative to the installed skill directory (normally `~/.copilot/skills/kainos-brand-enforcer/`), not to the repo you are working in.

Distilled from *Kainos Brand and Visual Identity Guidelines, Version 1.0, April 2020*. For edge cases or detailed worked examples, consult `references/docs/brand-guide.pdf`.

## 1. Logo

- **Primary logo** (full-colour positive or full-colour negative) is used wherever possible.
- **Secondary logo** (mono negative) only when the primary logo would be illegible — e.g. on bright green backgrounds or on the Kainos gradient.
- The logo includes three elements: logotype, green globe device replacing the "o", and the registered trademark symbol ®. Never separate, stylise, recolour, or stretch the logo.
- Maintain the exclusion zone around the logo as defined in section 2.1.3 of the brand guide.
- For partner/client co-branding, use the dual-branding system (vertical divider, equal weighting) — see section 2.1.8.

## 2. Colour palette

### Primary (use these as the foundation of every layout)

| Name | HEX | RGB | Pantone |
|------|-----|-----|---------|
| Kainos blue | `#283583` | 40, 53, 131 | 287 |
| Kainos green | `#61a83f` | 97, 168, 63 | 7737 |
| White | `#ffffff` | 255, 255, 255 | — |
| Kainos mid blue | `#41679f` | 65, 103, 159 | 7683 |
| Kainos dark green | `#004631` | 0, 70, 49 | 3435 |
| Kainos grey | `#575756` | 87, 87, 86 | 425 |

### Secondary (use sparingly — emphasis only)

| Name | HEX | RGB | Pantone |
|------|-----|-----|---------|
| Kainos orange | `#ec6608` | 236, 102, 8 | 1585 |
| Kainos bright green | `#cfd600` | 207, 214, 0 | 381 |
| Kainos bright blue | `#009fda` | 0, 159, 218 | Process Cyan |

### Colour rules (enforce on every output)

- **Never lead with a secondary colour.** Secondary colours support — they don't carry — a layout.
- **Secondary colours must not exceed 20%** of the colour on a single page (or 20% of total colour usage across a brochure).
- Always use at least one primary colour alongside any secondary colour.
- Tints from 5% to 90% of any primary colour are permitted for flexibility.
- Kainos grey is primarily for text — not as a layout fill.

## 3. The Kainos gradient

- Built from primary swatches: **Kainos dark green → Kainos green → Kainos mid blue → Kainos blue.**
- Permitted angles: 0°, 45°, -22.4°, or any other angle except ~90° (which makes it appear horizontal — not allowed).
- Use as a hero/cover background, behind large headlines, or on title slides.

## 4. Typography

| Tier | Font | Use |
|------|------|-----|
| Brand display | **Foundry Gridnik** (Bold / Medium / Light) | Large headlines, **UPPERCASE ONLY** |
| Brand body | **Galano Grotesque** (Light / Regular / Medium / Bold) | Page titles, headers, subheadings, body copy, captions |
| Provisional | **Century Gothic** (Bold / Regular) | Fallback in MS Office (Word, PowerPoint) when brand fonts aren't installed |

### Hierarchy (point sizes are guidance for brochures/PDFs — scale proportionally)

- **Headline** — Foundry Gridnik Bold, 50pt / 50pt leading, tracking 0, ALL CAPS.
- **Introduction** — Galano Grotesque Medium, 10pt / 12pt leading, tracking 0. Should be 1pt larger than the subheading.
- **Subheading** — Galano Grotesque Bold, 9pt / 11pt leading, tracking 0. Should be 2pt larger than body.
- **Body** — Galano Grotesque Regular (or Light, min 8pt), 7pt / 9pt leading, tracking 0.
- Headlines should be at least 20pt larger than the introduction text.

### Typography rules

- Headlines in Foundry Gridnik must be UPPERCASE.
- Mix font weights (Bold + Medium + Light) within a headline to accentuate key words — do not rely on colour alone for emphasis.
- Apply kerning to Foundry Gridnik for visually even spacing on display text.
- For pull-quotes: Galano Grotesque Medium for the opening speech mark and main quote; Galano Grotesque Bold for the attributed name; Galano Grotesque Regular for the job title.

## 5. Tone of voice (channelling Kainos)

- **All one Kainos.** Streamlined, cohesive, easy to use. Speak with one voice across every channel.
- **What we do:** "We overcome big challenges for businesses, using the best in talent and technology."
- **Why we exist:** "We use technology to make people's lives easier and make the world a little bit better, day by day."
- **Brand promise:** "We go beyond to change the way you work today and the impact you have tomorrow."
- **Brand proposition** (use verbatim only when summarising the brand): *"Partner with the best people in tech to transform the way you work today and the impact you have tomorrow."*

Style: confident, plain-spoken, optimistic, human. Avoid jargon-heavy corporate filler. Use sentence case for body copy; reserve all-caps for Foundry Gridnik display headlines.

---

## 6. What to avoid (the most common brand violations)

- ❌ Floods of secondary colour (e.g. all-orange or all-bright-green pages)
- ❌ Two secondary colours leading a layout (e.g. bright green + bright blue)
- ❌ Dark grey used as a primary fill — it should mainly carry text
- ❌ Replacing primary colours with near-matches (e.g. cyan instead of Kainos mid blue)
- ❌ Logo recoloured, stretched, rotated, or with the globe device removed/replaced
- ❌ Headlines in mixed case in Foundry Gridnik (must be UPPERCASE)
- ❌ Body copy in Foundry Gridnik (use Galano Grotesque or Century Gothic)
- ❌ Gradient applied at ~90° (looks horizontal; not allowed)

## 7. Templates available in this skill

Bundled local copies are available in `references/templates/`:

- `kainos-word-comprehensive.dotx` — the single Kainos Word template, used for every Word document (memos, reports, formal deliverables, anything with cover/TOC).
- `kainos-pptx-master.pptx` (`Powerpoint master template v2.potx`) — the single PowerPoint template, used for every deck.

> The legacy `Powerpoint template Style 1/2/3.potx` variants have been **retired** — do not pull them in. The v2 master is the only approved PowerPoint template. If a user asks for a "Style" variant, proceed with the v2 master and note it.

## 8. Visual assets available in this skill

Located in `references/assets/`:

- **`logos/`** — three core Kainos logo variants:
  - `kainos-logo-primary-transparent.png` (default, transparent background)
  - `kainos-logo-primary.png` (with background, fallback for tools that don't support transparency)
  - `kainos-logo-alt-transparent.png` (alternate variant — use on Kainos green or gradient)
- **Not bundled in this repo-local package:** sub-brand logos, icons, customer logos, partner logos, photography, illustrations, awards, and certifications. Fetch those from the Kainos Organization Assets site only when a deliverable specifically needs them.
